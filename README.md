You are free to suggest any feature for the bot, as long as it's related to Geometry Dash. You can also contribute directly to the project by following those simple steps:
* Fork the project and create a new branch
* Create a new bot user using the Discord Developers website
* Create a "bot-token.txt" file in the project root folder and paste the bot authentication token in it. **Important : make sure to place this file in the .gitignore file!**
* Make your bot join one of your servers that you're going to use for your tests
* When you're done, deploy the project on GitHub and open a pull request :)
