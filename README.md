# Contribute
You are free to suggest any feature for the bot, as long as it's related to Geometry Dash. You can also contribute directly to the project by following those steps:
* Fork the project and create a new branch
* Create a new bot user using the Discord Developers website
* Make your bot join one of your servers that you're going to use for your tests
* To run the bot, you must specify two arguments : the first one is the bot authentication token, and the second one is your own Discord user ID (for Superadmin-only commands)
* Add the environment variables DB\_USERNAME and DB\_PASSWORD to your system so the bot can connect to your own test database. Don't forget to run the database_structure.sql located in the docs folder in order to create the tables on your side!
* When you're done, deploy the project on GitHub and open a pull request by providing as much details as possible about your changes :)
