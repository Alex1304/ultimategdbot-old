# Contribute
You are free to suggest any feature for the bot, as long as it's related to Geometry Dash. You can also contribute directly to the project by following those simple steps:
* Fork the project and create a new branch
* Create a new bot user using the Discord Developers website
* Make your bot join one of your servers that you're going to use for your tests
* To run the bot, you must specify two arguments : the first one is the bot authentication token, and the second one is your Discord user ID (for Superadmin-only commands)
* When you're done, deploy the project on GitHub and open a pull request :)
